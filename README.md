Simple Spark Core Controller
============================

A customize-able simple Spark Core web app controller.

1. Enter your ``coreID`` and ``accessToken`` in the index.html file directly.

2. Enter a ``funcKey``, ``args`` (if desired) and button ``label`` for each function you want to control.

3. Any label that is not define such as ``""``, will automatically hide that button.

4. Name your app with the ``appHeading`` variable.
